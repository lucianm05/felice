Felice is a library of reusable, headless, accessibility-optimized components developed for React.js with TypeScript. It guarantees accessibility and functionality of complex components that are not found natively in HTML, and ease of integration into different projects is a goal in itself. Thus, it provides ways in which components can be customised, both in terms of appearance and functionality.
