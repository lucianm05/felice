Felice is a library of reusable, headless, accessibility-optimized components developed for React.js with TypeScript. It guarantees accessibility and functionality of complex components that are not found natively in HTML, and ease of integration into different projects is a goal in itself. Thus, it provides ways in which components can be customised, both in terms of appearance and functionality.
The components present in the Felice library comply with the ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) accessibility standards, present in the "Authoring Practices Guide" (APG) which aim to "describe how to apply accessibility semantics to common design patterns and widgets" (W3C, 2023). According to these standards, each component must implement certain aria attributes, have a semantic structure and allow keyboard interaction.
